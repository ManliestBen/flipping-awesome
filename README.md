# flipping-awesome

# Instructions:
## 
## The class will complete this exercise together as a group.  The  picker.html file is tuned-for the ATX group and will randomly pick students and start a 5 minute countdown.  When the countdown finishes, the next student will share their screen, come up front, and continue working on the problem with the group.  Everyone will work on the code on their own computers, sharing their screen with the class during their 5 minute window.

# Objectives:
## 
## - Add Bootstrap styling for the button
## - Display piles of cards on the screen
##      - When initialized, one pile should be empty, the other full
## - When the button is pressed, flip one of the cards face up into the empty space
## - Every button press flips an additional card until there are no remaining cards, showing an empty pile

## 
## 
## What you've been given to start:
## 
## - HTML/CSS/JS template in proper directory structure
## - CSS file for displaying cards by using class selectors
## - 4 'demo' <div> elements that show a few card options
##       - (Check out the CSS file and see what your options are!)
## - Link to Bootstrap to spice up the button.  Nobody likes plain buttons.  Nobody.

# Hints:
## 
## Start by talking through/white-boarding the problem and list out what steps you need to take to reach the objective.

## Declare variables and set up cached element references.

## Set up an initialization function.

## Set up en event handler that calls a function on button-click.

## Set up the function to necessary actions when the event handler is activated.

## Set up a render function to display any changes made to state variables on the screen.
